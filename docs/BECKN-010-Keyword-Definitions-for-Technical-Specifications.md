# Keyword Definitions for Technical Specifications

Abstract
This document outlines the definitions of key words that are commonly used in technical specifications, standards, and protocols. The aim is to provide a uniform interpretation of these terms to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretation.

Introduction
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described below. These definitions aim to ensure that the terms are understood precisely and consistently to avoid confusion in the interpretation of standards, specifications, and protocols.

Definitions
MUST
The term "MUST" implies an absolute requirement. Failure to meet a "MUST" requirement means that the item in question does not conform to the standard, and thus cannot claim compliance.

MUST NOT
The term "MUST NOT" indicates an absolute prohibition. If an item violates a "MUST NOT" requirement, it is considered non-compliant with the standard.

REQUIRED
The term "REQUIRED" is synonymous with "MUST" and indicates an absolute requirement that has to be fulfilled.

SHALL
The term "SHALL" is equivalent to "MUST" and indicates an absolute requirement. Not fulfilling a "SHALL" requirement makes the item non-compliant.

SHALL NOT
The term "SHALL NOT" is equivalent to "MUST NOT" and indicates an absolute prohibition.

SHOULD
The term "SHOULD" indicates a strong recommendation. While not an absolute requirement, failure to adhere to a "SHOULD" guideline may result in suboptimal behavior or interoperability issues.

SHOULD NOT
The term "SHOULD NOT" indicates a strong recommendation against a particular action. While not an absolute prohibition, taking the action cautioned against may result in suboptimal behavior or interoperability issues.

RECOMMENDED
The term "RECOMMENDED" is synonymous with "SHOULD" and indicates a course of action that is advised for optimal compliance and interoperability.

MAY
The term "MAY" indicates that an item is truly optional. There is no recommendation or requirement to implement the feature described.

OPTIONAL
The term "OPTIONAL" is synonymous with "MAY" and indicates that the implementation of a particular feature is at the discretion of the party involved.

Conclusion
The definitions provided in this document are intended to clarify the interpretation of key terms used in technical specifications, standards, and protocols. Adherence to these definitions will ensure a consistent understanding and implementation of such documents.
